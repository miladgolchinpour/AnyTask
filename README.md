# AnyTask
Multiplatform task management app with CoreData\
With beginner features: Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) for tasks\
I focused on basic CoreData in this application
- Available for iOS, iPadOS and macOS

**All of the code is for example and application isn't created for real usage**

***For better result run app locally on Xcode Simulator***
